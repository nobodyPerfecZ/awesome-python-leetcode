        You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing
        order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1
        and nums2 respectively.

        Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

        The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be
        stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n,
        where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the
        last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
